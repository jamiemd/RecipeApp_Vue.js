# RecipeApp_Vue.js

A simple app that let's users create recipes by entering the recipe name, ingredients and instructions. A listing of all recipes are shown on the left of the page and when a user clicks on a recipe, the recipe is queried and shown on the right. A recipe can be edited and deleted when viewed.

I used Vue for the front end and MongoDB for the database.
